LOOT BOX APP - CARD ICON STRIP REFINEMENTS                          V[TIME]
================================================================================
File to modify: index.html

IMPORTANT - VERSION NUMBER:
Update the version number displayed next to the main app title
("Loot Box Creator") in the header. The version format is V followed
by the current time in 24hr format with no colon. For example if it
is 1:32pm the version is V1332. If it is 4:10pm the version is V1610.
Update this every time you make changes.


================================================================================
OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Refine the left-edge icon strip on box cards:
1. Shift icons down away from GROUP badge
2. Increase spacing between icons
3. Add distinct color per icon type
4. Add a small number/value to the right of each icon
5. Ensure opens remaining icon is present and working


================================================================================
CHANGE 1: SHIFT ICONS DOWN + MORE SPACING
================================================================================

The icon strip currently sits too close to the GROUP/LOCAL badge
in the top-left corner. Fix:

- Add top margin or offset so the first icon starts clearly BELOW
  the GROUP badge. There should be at least 12-16px of breathing
  room between the bottom of the GROUP badge and the first icon.

- Increase the gap between icons from the current value to 14px
  (flex gap: 14px). Each icon + number row needs room to breathe.


================================================================================
CHANGE 2: NUMBERS NEXT TO ICONS
================================================================================

Each icon now has a small number/value displayed to its RIGHT.

Layout per icon row:
  - display: flex
  - align-items: center
  - gap: 6px
  - The icon container (30x30 rounded square) on the left
  - The number/value text on the right

Number text styling:
  - font-size: 0.7rem
  - font-weight: 600
  - font-family: inherit
  - color: same as the icon color (matches per icon type below)
  - No parentheses, no brackets, just the bare value
  - text-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) for readability

Values per icon type:

  ITEM COUNT:
    Show: just the number
    Examples: "4", "7", "12"

  OPENS REMAINING:
    Show: used/total or infinity symbol
    Examples: "2/10", "0/5", "∞"
    If unlimited: show "∞" (infinity character)
    If limited: show "opensUsed/maxPulls"
    opensUsed = pullHistory.length (or count of total opens)

  PER-PERSON LIMIT:
    Show: just the max number
    Examples: "1", "3", "5"

  PARTICIPANTS:
    Show: count of unique participants
    Examples: "3", "7"
    Calculate from pullHistory - count unique userNames or deviceIds

  EXPIRATION:
    Show: countdown text (short format)
    Examples: "2d 5h", "23h", "45m", "30s"
    Use existing formatExpirationCountdown function


================================================================================
CHANGE 3: DISTINCT COLORS PER ICON TYPE
================================================================================

Each icon type gets its own color. Both the icon SVG stroke AND the
number text should use this color.

  ITEM COUNT (layers icon):
    Color: #94a3b8 (silver gray)
    This is informational/neutral.

  OPENS REMAINING (box/package icon):
    Color changes based on status:
    - Unlimited: #94a3b8 (gray)
    - Plenty remaining (more than 50%): #10b981 (green)
    - Running low (50% or less remaining): #f59e0b (amber)
    - Very low (1-2 left): #ef4444 (red)
    - Depleted (0 left): #ef4444 (red), icon opacity: 0.5
    The number text color should match the icon color.

  PER-PERSON LIMIT (single person icon):
    Color: #8b5cf6 (purple)
    Always this color.

  PARTICIPANTS (people group icon):
    Color: #3b82f6 (blue)
    Always this color.

  EXPIRATION (clock icon):
    Color changes based on urgency:
    - More than 24h: #94a3b8 (gray)
    - Less than 24h: #f59e0b (amber)
    - Less than 1h: #ef4444 (red), add subtle pulse animation
    The number text color should match the icon color.

Apply the color to:
  - The SVG icon: style={{ color: iconColor }}
  - The number text: style={{ color: iconColor }}
  - The icon container border can also subtly tint:
    border: 1px solid ${iconColor}20  (icon color at ~12% opacity)


================================================================================
CHANGE 4: ENSURE OPENS REMAINING ICON EXISTS
================================================================================

Double-check that the opens remaining icon (box/package) is being
rendered on every card. It should ALWAYS show, whether the box has
a max opens limit or is unlimited.

If the box has no maxPulls (unlimited):
  - Show the box icon with "∞" next to it
  - Color: #94a3b8 (gray)

If the box has maxPulls set:
  - Show opens used vs total: "2/10"
  - Color based on remaining percentage (see Change 3)

If all opens are used up:
  - Show "5/5" (or whatever the max is)
  - Color: #ef4444 (red)
  - Icon at 0.5 opacity


================================================================================
CHANGE 5: ICON CONTAINER BORDER TINTING
================================================================================

Currently all icon containers have the same border color. Update
each icon container's border to subtly reflect its icon color:

  border: 1px solid rgba(ICON_COLOR, 0.2)

This creates a subtle visual grouping where each icon's container
has a faint tint of its own color. Not dramatic, just enough to
reinforce the color coding.

The background stays the same for all: rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.7)


================================================================================
TOOLTIP STILL WORKS
================================================================================

The tooltip system stays the same. Tapping the icon still shows a
tooltip bubble with a plain-English explanation. The number provides
the quick data; the tooltip provides the context for new users.

Tooltip text should be slightly updated to be more conversational
since the number already shows the data:

  ITEM COUNT: "This box has 4 items to discover"
  OPENS: "2 out of 10 opens used" or "Unlimited opens available"
  PER-PERSON: "Each person can open 1 time"
  PARTICIPANTS: "3 people have opened this box"
  EXPIRATION: "This box expires in 2d 5h"
